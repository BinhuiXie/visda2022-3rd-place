x-axis is defined as left/right
y-axis is defined as up/down
z-axis is defined as forward/back

Rotations are given in degrees for each axis (euler). The angle represents how much to rotate clockwise
along the given axis. Default rotation of (0, 0, 0) represents the positive z axis direction (forward).


-fps value                             The desired frame rate, by default set to 60. Set to -1 to run
                                       as fast as the device can handle.

-hidefps                               Hides the fps counter

-poolmax value                         Max items per pool. Each category has its own pool. So if set to 10
                                       then the maximum items spawned will be 5x10=50 (5 categories total).
                                       If poolmax is not set then it will be 100 by default.

-resolution x y                        The output size of the screenshots taken

-framestokill value                    How many frames after the start of the simulation to kill the process.

-secondstokill value                   How many seconds after the start of the simulation to kill the process.
                                       More reliable than framestokill when frames are dipping.





-camera x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 [delay]      Spawns a camera with the given (x1, y1, z1) world space position
        [fov]                          and (x2, y2, z2) rotation. If no camera is given then a camera
                                       is created at position (0, 2.5, 0) and rotation (90, 0, 0). To
                                       not have any cameras refer to -nocamera. The delay value tells the
                                       camera how long to wait (in seconds) between screenshots. FOV is the
                                       horizontal viewing angle of the camera in degrees. Default FOV is 60.

-light type x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 [range]  Spawns a light with the given (x1, y1, z1) world space position
       [intensity] [spotAngle]         and (x2, y2, z2) rotation. By default range is 10 and intensity is 1.
       [innerSpotAngle] [r] [g] [b]    If no light is given then a directional light is created by default.        
       [a]                             Light types include: Directional, Point, and Spot
                                       If the type is not Spot then spotAngle and innerSpotAngle should be
                                       skipped. If the type is Spot and spotAngle and innerSpotAngle are
                                       skipped, then they default to 30 and 21.8 respectively. RGBA color
                                       is optional, if not provided then defaults to (1, 0.96, 0.84, 1).

-nocamera                              This stops the default camera from being created when no cameras are
                                       created by the user.

-nolight                               This stops the default light from being created when no lights are
                                       created by the user.





-spawnitems type delay [spawnRate]     Spawn items of a specific type with a delay between each item spawn in
            [minScale] [maxScale] [x1] seconds. Types include: rigid_plastic, soft_plastic, metal, cardboard,
            [y1] [z1] [x2] [y2] [z2]   paper. The delay value represents how much time it takes for items to
                                       spawn in seconds. So for a value of 0, items will be spawned every frame.
                                       The spawn rate sets how many items to be spawned each time the spawn delay
                                       passes. By default it is set to 1. Min scale and max scale are by default
                                       set to 1. Everytime an item is spawned a scale value is chosen randomly between
                                       min and max scale and is applied to the size and mass of the spawned object.
                                       (x1, y1, z1) represents the center point of the spawn volume in world space.
                                       Default is (0, 2, 0) if not provided. (x2, y2, z2) represent the volume the
                                       items will spawn in. A value is chosen randomly for each axis that lies within
                                       the given volume. Default is (0, 0, 0) if not provided. These values are in
                                       meters.





-convpos x y z                         The center top point of the conveyor belt in world space, (0, 1, 0) by
                                       default.

-convpercentspd value                  The speed the conveyor will move at in percent per physics frame
                                       (1 means a full revolution per physics frame, 0.5 means half a
                                       revolution per physics frame), 0.001 by default.

-convlen value                         How long the belt loop is (on each flat side) in meters, 5 by default.

-convheight value                      The gap between the top and bottom sides of the conveyor belt in
                                       meters, 0.8 by default.

-panelcount value                      The number of panels the conveyor belt will have, 20 by default.

-panelgap value                        The gap between each panel of the conveyor belt in meters, 0.05 by default.

-panelwidth value                      How wide each panel will be in meters, 2 by default.

-panelthick value                      How thick each panel will be in meters, 0.02 by default.
